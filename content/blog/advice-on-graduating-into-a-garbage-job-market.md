"Down the way where the nights are gay and the sun shines daily on the mountain top. I took a trip on a sailing ship and when I reached Jamaica I made a stop." Why not make a stop.

1)Negril Beach and the Negril Cliffs

Also called as Seven Mile Beach, Negril Beach is Jamaica's most beautiful beach consisting of crystal white sand and aquamarine. It aces the list of the Caribbean's top listed beaches. This locale spreads from Bloody Bay to Long Bay and the Negril Cliffs towards the southern end of the town. Situated within acres of coconut trees, resorts line the seacoast here. All types. Ranging from large all-inclusive resorts to compact boutiques. Water sports are ample, and people will find schools of fish swimming in the clear waters.

2) Martha Brae River

Rafting the Martha Brae is acclaimed as the most popular thing in Jamaica. At Martha Brae Rafter's Village, one can slide down a splendid stretch of the river on bamboo rafts poled by local guides. This relaxation giving journey is a good method so as to take in some of the tropical scenery, and some prized information about the land via the tourist guides along the way, who are sharing information regarding the flora and fauna.

3)Dunn's River Falls

Crossing the 180 meters of aptly flowing waterfalls, Dunn's River Falls is known as Jamaica's most famous nature gifted attraction. The falls flow over rocks and limestone ledges as they delve towards the sea. One could climb the natural tiers to the top of the falls with the aid of a guide and cool off in the refreshing pools at the base. It makes one heck of a good idea to put on water shoes and clothing, that is if one minds getting wet.

4) Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park

Recently, the splendid Blue and John Crow Mountains National Park was initiated upon the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites. Why? For the sake of its rich natural and cultural heritage. Once upon a time it acted as a refuge for slaves and the indigenous Taino, who had often fled there so as to escape slavery. This unmolested preserve offers breathtaking scenery.

5)Port Antonio

Tucked within mountains and boasted with a double harbor, Port Antonio exuberates a calming charm typical of a fantasy coastal village. In historical times, it was a center for banana export. But nowadays the area is distinctly less commercial than the other resort towns. Celebrated things to do here are inclusive of hiking jungle trails, rafting the Rio Grande, taking a tour to Reach Falls, and snorkeling and diving the coral reefs. A nice swimming area is the beautiful 60-meter-deep Blue Lagoon, which is drawn by hot water and fresh springs.

6)Doctor's Cave Beach, Montego Bay 

Some of the best beaches are in Montego Bay. And Doctor's Cave Beach is the bes. For it is an intricate strip of white sand fringed by clear waters that helped shape the destiny of such a celebrated holiday spot. During the 1920s, a famous British osteopath had declared that this water found here was possessing curative and medicative powers. Thus many fled for swimming here. Then it became popular and began to lure visitors from across the globe. Hotels rose up, and the locale developed as a very popular tourist spot.
