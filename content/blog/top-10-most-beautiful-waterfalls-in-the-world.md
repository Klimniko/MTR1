  10) Jog Falls, India: Deep in the state of Karnataka lies the majestic Jog (or
  Joga) Falls, also known as the second steepest waterfall in all of India. When
  to go? Though pleasant throughout the year, Spring to early Summer (April to
  July) is the best time to go for a great balance between high water levels and
  low heat, as the temperatures tend to stay between 23 and 32 degrees celsius.


  9) Sutherland Falls, New Zealand: Tucked away on New Zealand’s South Island is the breathtakingly beautiful Sutherland Falls. When is the best time to go? Late October to early April. 


  8) Gullfoss Falls, Iceland: Somewhere on the might Olfusa River rushes Gullfoss Falls, Iceland’s most iconic waterfall and a true indication of the natural, ice-toned beauty to be found throughout the country. It is suggested to visit in the afternoon, around 3pm-4pm for the best lighting by the cliffs.


  7) Kaieteur Falls, Guyana: This beautiful locale is nestled deep in the Amazon, and is said to be one of the many priceless treasures of the rainforest, and of South America in general. To visit, it is ideal to aim for a warm and dry day. Dry season in Guyana runs from March to June.


  6) Plitvice Falls, Croatia: To  pass up Plitvice Falls in Croatia would be a true rookie mistake. Plitvice Falls, which is part of Plitvice Lakes National Park (the largest National Park in Croatia) clocks in at 255 ft (77 m), making it a sight to see! Pack your bags in the summers, as Croatia features warm temperatures and sunny skies. The country is indeed as beautiful as their football.


  5) Yosemite Falls, California, USA: Few have experienced the impressive beauty of California’s Yosemite National Park and not emerged in a sense of being awestruck by its simple yet extravagant splendor. Visit in spring.


  4) Niagara Falls, New York and Ontario: When is a waterfall also a visit to two countries for the price of one? When that waterfall is the mighty Niagara, which famously straddles the border of the US (via New York State) and Ontario, Canada. The falls are impressively high at 167 feet (or 99 meters for you Canadians) but equally impressively long, stretching on for what feels like forever. 


  3) Angel Falls, Venezuela: For visitors to Venezuela it’s an absolutely must-see attraction. As if it’s sheer height wasn’t awe-inspiring enough, Angel Falls is also considered a UNESCO World Heritage Site. So when to pack your bags? Most river trips take place between June and December, when the water levels are high enough to ensure safe river passage and the views are the best.


  2) Iguazu Falls, Argentina and Brazil: Like with Niagara Falls, Iguazu Falls is a two-country-one-landmark special, as it straddles the border of Argentina and Brazil. So when to make a visit? March-April and August-September will find you in drier climes, but the falls may be a bit more crowded.


  1) Victoria Falls, Zambia and Zimbabwe: It is no surprise that the top of the list features the most famous waterfall in the world: the truly commanding Victoria Falls. They are located on the border of Zambia and Zimbabwe and accessible via the Western Zimbabwe town of the same name. So when to pack your bags? The temperate year-round weather around Victoria Falls only adds to its popularity.
