Saint Barthélemy is another French colonial Caribbean destination you should definitely visit. It combines European and Caribbean charm and is a wonderful blend of many different types of attractions. Here are some of the places you should check on your vacation on St. Barths.

## Saline Beach (Anse de Grande Saline)

This is one of the best beaches on the Caribbean that looks like a place from an ideal tropical postcard. However, it doesn’t offer natural shade, so you may want to bring something with you to solve this minor problem. It is a popular surfing spot as well and surrounded by some nice restaurants.

## Gustavia

Gustavia is the capital of St. Barthes. It is incredibly picturesque, charming and filled with various distractions, like shops, galleries, museums, and cafes. Some of the most famous historical sites are **Wall House Museum, Fort Gustavia, St. Bartholomew’s Anglican Episcopal Church** from the 19th-century, and the **Vieux Clocher,** the oldest building in town.
