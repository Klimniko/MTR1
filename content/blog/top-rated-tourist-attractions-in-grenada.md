Sometimes called the Spice Island, Grenada is a truly special location despite the fact that we could easily argue that every Caribbean destination is somewhat special. If you decide to visit this island, you will enjoy the local culture, colonial history, beautiful nature and inevitably attractive beaches. Here we bring you some of the Granada’s best sites.

## St. George’s

St. George’s is a typical Caribbean port town, colorful, busy and full of historical attractions. Some of them are the 18th-century forts, Fort George and Fort Frederick, but also the pretty houses and charming streets. Visit the buzzy St. George’s Market Square on Sundays, the Grenada National Museum or the House of Chocolate. This vibrant town’s history and culture are waiting to put a lasting spell on you.

## Underwater Sculpture Park

If you are in the mood for something eerie and somewhat spooky, try the Underwater Sculpture Park. The sculptures beneath the sea are equally beautiful as they are scary, however, they definitely offer a unique experience rarely found elsewhere.

## Morne Rouge Bay

Morne Rouge Bay is a good choice for those who prefer quiet and less crowded beaches. There are many resorts nearby where you can grab some lunch while enjoying your lazy days under the sun.

## Belmont Estate

This 17th- century plantation will introduce you to the local spice industry. Many tours are offered, so you get to choose the one that suits your interests. You can find out how chocolate is made and enjoy as nack, or visit the organic farm. There are many animals held there, which is perfect to attract the attention of children.

## Annandale Falls

This amazing waterfall is 10 meters high and surrounded by lovely landscape. Follow the trail starting at the Annandale Falls Center, swim at the base of the monumental cascades or do some souvenir shopping.
