1)Costa Sud and Costa Verde, Sardinia. Exotic beaches off the Sardinian coast are surely a sight of wonder. Did you also know that Sardinia is as historically significant as it is culturally? What are you waiting for? Pack your bags now!

2)San Vito Lo Capo, Sicily. Quaint, pristine, and beautiful. This beautiful fishing town off the Sicily coast, is meant to be a beautiful tourist location of the delights the Italian coast has to offer.

3)Capo Testa and the Maddalena Islands, Sardinia. Approximately most of all the beaches on Sardinia's famous Costa Smeralda are accessible by private boat only. The crystalline green waters ace the equally beautiful beaches around neighboring Capo Testa and the Maddalena Islands. Along with arched cliffs and rocky foothills are an addition of the mountainous hillscapes of Gallura.

4)The Salento, Puglia

Puglia is located at the heel of Italy's boot-shaped cartography. Located at the top tip of the heel is the rarely visited Salento, where the Adriatic and Ionian seas meet together as a sublime and largely pristine coast. Truly, splendid.![](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/lu9_jhLyzkC56qhLOmIbApTaci8RQ4DKwCBQfnoShz9yZv58SK1tbD8vmIYXi2NK6HPimQJg1S5BORFvDPna9Vqa5RNsjudWwibY9kHh7tKnb5QfPfw1bmQyLdbrzxsWASdIwJY)

5)Santa Margherita Ligure

There is a reminiscence of going back into the renaissance when you happen to be in Santa Margherita Ligure. This locale splendidly reminisces of a time where ladies and gentlemen spend seaside holidays amongst the serene hoardings of pastel shaded luxury hotels.

6)Elba

The rugged coast of Elba, an island which is on the coast of Tuscany, is plaid with more than 200 tiny sandy locales. Long sandy stretches to small single beaches cocooned in coves.

7)Sanremo

The heart of the famous Italian Riviera is Sanremo, famous as a gathering hole for royalty, nobility, the wealthy. Empress "Sisi" of Austria and Emperor Nicholas II of Russia would enjoy the year-round balmy climate and aided to its glamorous celebrity guestlist and aura. Moneyed visitors built Art Nouveau villas and gardens that still are in its streets.

8)Ischia

Historic Greeks and Romans often fled to the volcano laden island that is Ischia, in the Bay of Naples, to shower in its hot springs amid its luxuriant flora. One can easily get to Ischia from Naples harbor by ferry. Would you not like to be reminded of the luxurious and historically important days of the Roman Empire? Visit it now.

A small and public beach is difficultly found at the south end. As the evening is incoming,the buzz moves to the Belle Ã‰poque platform for more nocturnal events. Make a small visit for the luxurious and aesthetically pleasing Italian holiday stereotype that we so dream of after watching a Hollywood movie. Perhaps this might be where the dreamy scenes of the 2006 James Bond film Casino Royale must have been shot. Not stating anything though. Just wondering.
