Jamaica is a cultural icon for many reasons. It has a turbulent history, a clash of native and colonial civilizations, and a colorful connection to the modern pop culture since it is the birthplace of both reggae music, Rastafari and skinheads style. It is also connected to the setting of some classic novels. For example, the tragic Bertha Mason from Charlotte Bronte’s Jane Eyre is a person from Jamaica and represents all of the prejudice Victorian people had towards the inhabitants of their colonies.
